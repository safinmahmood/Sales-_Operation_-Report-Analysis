# Sales-_Operation_-Report-Analysis

In this Analysis, we did

1. Sales Analysis with Pivot Table and Conditional Formatting

-> Created a Pivot Table summarizing the total amount (BDT) and order quantity for each product category by division.
-> Used a Slicer for payment methods to filter the Pivot Table.
-> Applied conditional formatting to highlight the top 5 highest sales amounts (BDT) in the Pivot Table.

2. Moving Averages and Trends

-> Calculated the 3-period moving average for the total amount (BDT) by date.
-> Created a line chart to visualize the sales trend for the Dhaka division over time. Include the moving average in the chart for comparison.

3. INDEX-MATCH and Discount Calculation

-> Used the INDEX-MATCH formula to find the customer ID that purchased with the highest discount percentage each quarter.
-> Calculated the final amount after the discount for each order and create a summary table showing the customer ID, order date, total amount (BDT), discount, and final amount.

4. Conditional Formatting for Total Amount and Discount Percentage

-> Applied conditional formatting to the Total Amount (BDT) column to highlight values based on a 3-color scale:
Low amounts in blue.
Medium amounts in yellow.
High amounts in red.

-> Applied conditional formatting to the Discount (%) column, using data bars to visually represent the magnitude of the discounts. Higher discounts show longer bars.
